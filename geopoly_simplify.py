Polygon Simplification Package — Geological Map Vector Simplification

Overview
--------
Simplifies polygon and line shapefiles for geological maps while preserving
topological integrity.  Designed for GSWA-style datasets where polygon features
represent geological units and a separate line layer represents the fault network.

The main entry point is  vector_simplify_file_two_stage().  It runs a
three-stage pipeline:

  Stage 0 — Topology pre-processing
      1. Snaps all polygon vertex coordinates to a decimal grid to eliminate
         floating-point mismatches between adjacent features.
      2. Detects and corrects hairline overlaps and gaps between polygon rings
         so that polygon positions are finalised before any snapping occurs.
      3. Snaps fault↔polygon vertex pairs to their MIDPOINT so that fault and
         polygon boundaries that should coincide share exactly the same coordinate.
         Using the midpoint (rather than snapping one side to the other) avoids
         the position-swap bug: one-sided bidirectional snapping causes fault and
         polygon vertices that are millimetres apart to trade places — fault ends
         up where the polygon was and vice versa.  Moving both to the midpoint
         eliminates the swap.  This snap runs AFTER the overlap/gap fix so it
         targets the final corrected polygon positions.

  Stage 1 — Fault network simplification
      Simplifies the fault line network using Modified Visvalingam-Whyatt.
      Every vertex that lies on a polygon boundary is pinned (given infinite
      weight) so it is never removed.  This preserves the exact position of
      every fault-polygon crossing point through Stage 1.

  Stage 2 — Polygon simplification
      Simplifies each polygon using the chosen algorithm.  Before simplification:
        • Junction detection: every point where ≥ 3 features meet gets infinite
          weight and cannot be removed.
        • All-vertex pinning: every fault vertex that coincides with a polygon
          boundary vertex is pinned so fault–polygon alignment is maintained.
        • Boundary preservation: exterior arc vertices are either hard-pinned
          (cannot be removed) or soft-scaled (resist removal) depending on
          the boundary_preserve setting.
        • Unique geological contact pinning: for each unique CODE-pair that
          shares a polygon boundary, one representative vertex is pinned to
          ensure the contact relationship is always detectable in the output.
        • Thin-body arc pinning: for every narrow polygon at risk of collapsing
          at the requested threshold, its boundary arcs are pre-simplified at a
          conservative safe threshold and the surviving intermediate vertices are
          pinned.  This guarantees that both the thin body and its neighbours
          simplify the shared arc to the same vertex set, preventing gaps and
          overlaps on thin-body boundaries.
      Thin-body features are processed last so that all neighbour geometries are
      available if the collapse fallback is needed.
      After simplification a contact-health report is printed showing how many
      shared boundaries retain ≥ 3 vertices (meaningful shape), exactly 2
      (barely a line), 1 (point only — relationship preserved, shape lost),
      or 0 (boundaries diverged — reduce tolerance).

Geological contact preservation
---------------------------------
A "unique geological contact" is a shared boundary between two polygon
features with DIFFERENT values in the unit identifier field (default: CODE).
For each such pair the algorithm:
  1. Computes the shared boundary (boundary_A ∩ boundary_B via Shapely).
  2. Selects the vertex closest to the centroid of the shared boundary as the
     representative — a stable, central anchor point.
  3. Adds that vertex to dict_junctions with infinite area weight so it is
     never removed by Visvalingam-Whyatt regardless of the threshold.
After simplification, the shared boundaries of every contact pair are
re-examined and classified as preserved / minimal / shape-lost / diverged.

Self-intersection prevention
------------------------------
Thin polygons (fold stripes, dyke outlines) can produce self-intersecting
("bowtie") output after simplification.  Two mechanisms prevent this:

  1. Ring-mode guard (whole-ring simplification path):
     Before committing to any vertex removal, the proposed replacement edge
     (prev → next) is tested against every non-adjacent ring edge using a
     fast pure-Python cross-product test (_segments_cross).  If it would
     cross, the vertex is kept (treated as constrained for the rest of the
     run) and simplification continues with the next candidate.

  2. Arc-assembly guard (arc-cache path for junction-constrained polygons):
     Each arc is simplified independently and the results are reassembled
     into a ring.  If the assembled ring is not geometrically simple (two
     arcs cross at the tip of a thin polygon), the code falls back to
     whole-ring simplification, which has the ring-mode guard above.

  Both paths also apply a post-simplification make_valid() repair as an
  ultimate safety net: if the finished ring is still not simple (a sequence
  of individually-safe removals can cumulatively produce a crossing), the
  ring is repaired by splitting at the crossing and keeping the largest
  valid polygon part.

  The arc cache only stores geometrically simple (non-self-intersecting)
  arcs.  A self-intersecting arc is not cached so adjacent polygons that
  share the same boundary arc are not affected.

Thin body detection and topology-safe simplification
------------------------------------------------------
Before simplification, every polygon body is checked for approximate minimum
width (≈ 2 × area / perimeter).  If min_width < √(threshold) / 2, the body
is flagged as at-risk of collapsing.

Thin bodies (fold stripes, dyke outlines) are narrow polygons that share
long boundary arcs with wider neighbours.  If a shared arc is simplified too
aggressively, it collapses to just its two endpoint junctions — which
eliminates the thin body's interior.  To prevent this, every thin-body arc
is pre-simplified at a conservative safe threshold (= smallest thin-body area
/ 4) before the main simplification run.  Every intermediate vertex that
survives the pre-simplification is pinned into dict_junctions (given infinite
area weight).  During the main run every polygon sharing those arcs — the
thin body and all its neighbours — treats those vertices as immovable hard
constraints.  This guarantees that the shared boundary simplifies to the same
vertex set for every touching polygon regardless of processing order, so no
gaps or overlaps can arise on thin-body boundaries.

Thin bodies are also processed last in the feature loop, after all their
neighbours have already been simplified.  This ensures that the collapse
fallback (below) has access to the fully-simplified neighbour geometries.

Collapse fallback
-----------------
If arc-mode MVW still cannot produce a valid simplified ring (the arc
subdivision can leave very short arcs that individually cannot be simplified),
three successive fallbacks are tried:

  1. Ring-mode retry: simplify the whole exterior as a single ring — no arc
     splitting — at the original threshold, stepping down 10 % per attempt
     until a result is found that does not overlap any already-simplified
     neighbour.

  2. Neighbour-clip: if every ring-mode threshold overlaps a neighbour,
     compute  this_polygon = original_geometry − union(overlapping_neighbours).
     The shared boundary then exactly matches the neighbour's simplified edge.

  3. Write original: if the clipped remainder is empty (the polygon's entire
     territory has been absorbed by its simplified neighbours at this
     tolerance), the original unsimplified geometry is written.  The output
     always contains the same number of features as the input; reduce the
     threshold to obtain a simplified result for these features.

Six simplification algorithms
-------------------------------
1. Decimation              — nth-point removal (Tobler 1966, Miller 2004)
2. Douglas-Peucker         — perpendicular distance (Douglas & Peucker 1973)
3. Douglas-Peucker TP      — topology-preserving GEOS variant (Saalfeld 1999)
4. Bend Simplification     — compactness-based bend removal (Visvalingam & Whyatt 1990)
5. Visvalingam-Whyatt      — area-based vertex removal (Visvalingam & Whyatt 1992)
6. Modified Visvalingam-Whyatt — topology-preserving two-stage pipeline with
                               fault network consistency (arc caching, junction
                               pinning, boundary preservation, contact pinning)

        """
        Identify every unique geological unit contact and select one
        representative vertex per contact pair to pin in dict_junctions.

        A "unique contact" is a shared polygon boundary between two features
        with DIFFERENT values in `unit_field`.  Self-contacts (same unit
        touching itself across multiple polygon bodies) are excluded.

        Algorithm
        ---------
        1. Load all polygon features with their unit code and Shapely geometry.
        2. Build an STRtree for fast candidate-pair lookup.
        3. For each candidate pair (i, j) where code_i ≠ code_j:
             shared = boundary_i ∩ boundary_j
             If non-empty: collect the vertex in `shared` that is closest
             to the centroid of `shared` as the representative.
        4. Add the quantized representative to dict_junctions (infinite
           area weight → cannot be removed by VW regardless of threshold).

        Parameters
        ----------
        polygon_file : path to polygon shapefile
        unit_field   : attribute field that identifies the geological unit
                       (default 'CODE' for GSWA datasets)

        Returns
        -------
        (contacts : dict, representative_vertices : set)

        contacts maps  frozenset({code_a, code_b})  →

              'representative': (x, y),       # chosen pin coordinate
            }

        representative_vertices is the set of quantized (x, y) coordinates
        added to dict_junctions (one per unique contact pair, unless a
        representative was already in dict_junctions from a prior step).

    One-sided bidirectional snapping (fault → polygon, then polygon → fault)

    ends up where the polygon was, and the polygon ends up where the fault was.

    Snapping before topology fixing caused the fault to align with polygon
    positions that were subsequently moved by the overlap/gap correction,
    leaving the fault misaligned with the corrected boundary.

    This runs BEFORE any of the six vector simplification methods and
    directly addresses:
      (a) Polygon-only topology:  hairline overlaps and gaps due to
          floating-point mismatches between adjacent polygon rings.
      (b) Fault-polygon alignment (MVW only):  fault and polygon vertices
          that should coincide differ by up to snap_distance metres due to
          digitising in separate sessions or different CRS precision.

    Cross-dataset snap logic (Step 4, when fault_file is provided)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    Two passes are made, each using ORIGINAL vertex coordinates as anchors
    so that the canonical coordinate for every mismatched pair is consistent:

      Pass 1  fault → polygon
              For every fault vertex within snap_distance of a polygon vertex,
              the fault vertex is moved to exactly match the polygon vertex
              (rounded to snap_decimals decimal places).
              The polygon vertex does NOT move — it is the authoritative anchor.

      Pass 2  polygon → fault  (using original, pre-pass-1 fault coordinates)
              For every polygon vertex within snap_distance of an ORIGINAL fault
              vertex, the polygon vertex is moved to exactly match that fault
              vertex (rounded to snap_decimals decimal places).
              This handles the complementary case where the polygon boundary is
              slightly off from where the fault runs.

    After both passes every fault-polygon vertex pair that was within
    snap_distance now shares exactly the same coordinate at snap_decimals
    decimal-place precision (≤ 0.0000001 m with the default of 7).

    Parameters

    fix_overlaps  : detect and fix polygon–polygon overlaps (default True)
    fix_gaps      : detect and fill polygon mosaic gaps (default True)
    fault_file    : fault network shapefile — enables cross-dataset snap
    snap_distance : max distance (m) between fault and polygon vertices to
                    treat as the same point (default 0.01 m = 1 cm)
